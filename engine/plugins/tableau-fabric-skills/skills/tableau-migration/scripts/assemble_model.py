"""Assemble a complete, Fabric-deployable semantic model DEFINITION from a Tableau ``.tds``.

This is the Tier-1 orchestrator that ties the offline cores together into a single
deployable artifact:

    parse_tds  ->  select_storage_mode  ->  typed tables (M / DirectLake)
               ->  translate calcs -> DAX measures (formulas preserved)
               ->  model / database / expressions / relationships
               ->  the Fabric **SemanticModel** item definition (TMDL parts + .platform + .pbism)

It is pure and offline: it returns an in-memory ``dict`` of ``{relative_path: text}`` (the
exact layout Fabric's *Get/Update Semantic Model Definition* API expects). The caller either
writes the files to a ``<Name>.SemanticModel`` folder (for a ``.pbip`` / git) or base64-encodes
each part into the Fabric ``createOrUpdate`` payload (see ``fabric_definition_payload``).

Storage paths:
* **Import / DirectQuery** (direct-to-upstream): tables use ``= m`` partitions from
  ``connection_to_m.emit_table_tmdl_m``; connection parameters become named expressions.
* **Needs-storage-decision fallback** (``mode is None``): the shape can't be rebuilt
  direct-to-source, so it is reported as a fallback (default: land as Import direct-to-source).
  DirectLake is an explicit opt-in -- ``assemble_directlake_model`` reuses the import-model
  generators after data is landed as Delta -- never auto-selected.

Credentials are never embedded. Anything outside the safe subset stays an inert ``= 0`` stub
with its original formula preserved as a ``TableauFormula`` annotation.

    A positional table calc (LOOKUP/OFFSET/WINDOW/percent-difference) orders by the worksheet's
    continuous-date axis pill, whose caption resolves through ``resolve`` to the FACT date column
    (e.g. ``Orders[Order_Date]``). The rebuilt visual, however, groups that axis on the marked
    calendar KEY of the generated Date dimension (``Date[Date]`` -- see ``twb_to_pbir`` date
    binding), so the faithful ORDERBY walks the SAME marks as the visual only when it sorts on
    ``Date[Date]`` (previous-MARK = previous data-date on a data-dates-only categorical axis).

    Returns a ``resolver(caption) -> (date_table, date_key, type, source_fact) | None`` that
    redirects EXACTLY the captions resolving to an ACTIVE fact date column -- the ``(table, column)``
    pairs in ``active_date_cols`` (the ``is_active`` side of the Date relationships) -- and returns
    None for every other caption so the normal resolver handles it unchanged. The 4th tuple element
    is the FACT table the caption originally resolved to (e.g. ``Orders``): the calc compiler collects
    it as the ``required_facts`` the redirect depends on, so it can fail-closed when the inner
    aggregate is on an UNRELATED table (whose order would not propagate through the Date relationship).
    Returns ``None`` (no redirect) when there is no Date dimension or no active date column, making the
    no-date-dimension path byte-for-byte identical.

    DISABLED (not wired into the model build): the redirect is ORDERBY-only -- the inner aggregate and
    the partition stay on the fact -- on the assumption that the Date->fact relationship would propagate
    the date order to the aggregate. That assumption is FALSE for OFFSET/WINDOW. Microsoft's spec
    requires, when the ``relation`` argument is omitted, that every ``orderBy``/``partitionBy`` column
    come from a SINGLE table; ordering on ``Date[Date]`` while partitioning on ``Orders`` is cross-table
    and the live Fabric engine rejects it (``0x413A0003``: "OFFSET's Relation parameter is omitted. In
    this case, all OrderBy and PartitionBy columns must be from the same table."). The sole call site
    therefore passes ``order_resolver=None`` so the ORDERBY resolves to the fact's own date column (same
    table as the partition -> valid single-table DAX). This builder is retained for a future
    relation-supplying implementation (emit an explicit ``<relation>`` spanning the calendar key + the
    partition) that would make calendar-key ordering valid; until then it must NOT be re-wired.

    """Translate row-level (dimension) ``dim_calcs`` via column mode and group the rendered
    calculated-column TMDL by target table, plus a per-column report.

    ``dim_calcs`` is an iterable of ``{"name", "formula"}`` -- the dimension-role calcs surfaced
    by ``migrate_estate.extract_calculations(..., include_dimensions=True)``. Each is run through
    ``translate_tableau_calc_to_column_dax`` (ROW context), so a bare ``[field]`` resolves and the
    row-level string/date/cast functions are available.

    Calcs whose name is in ``consumed`` (case-insensitive) are skipped -- a dimension-swap calc has
    already become a field-parameter table and must NOT also be emitted as a calculated column.
    Note ``param_resolver`` is deliberately NOT threaded here: a value/what-if ``[Parameters].[X]``
    reads the slicer FILTER context via ``SELECTEDVALUE``, which a calculated COLUMN (row context,
    refresh-time) cannot see -- it would freeze at the default. Row-level param references therefore
    correctly stay inert stubs (the faithful Power BI answer is a slicer, not a frozen column).

    Binding follows that translator's contract: a single resolved ``{T}`` is the home table; a
    constant (no field refs) and any honest ``= BLANK()`` stub default to ``anchor_table`` so a
    dimension calc is NEVER silently dropped (today's behavior) and always carries its preserved
    ``TableauFormula`` for audit/repair. Aggregations / LODs / multi-table terms fall back to the
    inert stub here -- the measure entry point owns those. Returns ``(by_table, report, column_refs)``
    where ``by_table`` is ``{table_display: concatenated_tmdl}`` and ``column_refs`` is the
    calc-column identity map ``{caption/token(lower): (home_table, column_name, tmdl_type)}`` for
    every faithfully-emitted single-home typed calc column (keyed by BOTH caption and internal token).
    The orchestrator layers ``column_refs`` onto the base resolver it hands the MEASURE path, so a
    measure whose formula references a calculated column -- most importantly a FIXED-LOD grain over a
    calculated dimension, e.g. ``{FIXED [Order Date (Months)] : SUM([Sales])}`` -- binds to that real
    column instead of stubbing. A calc column is a genuine row-level model column, so this only ADDS a
    resolution path base ``resolve`` lacked; a bare row-level reference in a measure still stubs.

    ``relationships`` (the model's raw relationship list) is forwarded to the column translator so a
    cross-table row-level calc can materialize on one home table via LOOKUPVALUE (see
    ``translate_tableau_calc_to_column_dax``). Default None -> the prior cross-table stub.

    SIBLING CALC CASCADE: a dimension calc that references ANOTHER dimension calc column (a chain
    such as ``[Grouped Category] = SWITCH(TRUE(), [Cleaned Category] = ...)`` where
    ``[Cleaned Category] = UPPER([Category])``) resolved to an ``unresolved_reference`` stub before,
    because the sibling is being created and is absent from the datasource-metadata ``resolve``. A
    pre-scan fix-point (mirroring the measures' ``measure_refs`` cascade) records each
    deterministically-translated single-home calc, so the main pass resolves a bare ``[Sibling Calc]``
    to ``'Home'[Sibling Calc]`` with its real type. Fail-closed: only a faithful, single-home, typed
    sibling is a reference target (a sibling on another table still trips the single-table guard), so
    a chain that cannot be resolved stays a stub -- never wrong DAX.

    ASSISTED TRANSLATION (opt-in): ``approved_calc_dax`` (``{calc_name: dax}``, case-insensitive) is
    the column-mode peer of the measures' approved landing. It is consulted ONLY when the
    deterministic tier produced no DAX (a stub), so a faithful Tier-0 calculated column is never
    overridden. A match flips the inert stub into a LIVE calculated column tagged
    ``TranslatedBy = assisted translation (human-approved)`` with status ``assisted-approved``; the
    original Tableau formula is preserved as ``TableauFormula``. With no approval the behavior is
    byte-for-byte unchanged.

    Each value may be the flat string ``"DAX"`` or the additive dict ``{"dax": "DAX", "table":
    "TargetTable"}``. The dict form lets the approver name the calc's home table -- the fix for a
    row-context calc Tier 0 could not place, which otherwise defaults to ``anchor_table`` and yields
    invalid row-context DAX. A named ``table`` overrides the computed home only when it is in
    ``known_tables`` (the caller injects each block into an existing table part, so an unknown name
    would be silently dropped); an unknown name keeps the computed home and is recorded on the report
    row as ``approved_target_unknown``. The honored/requested target is echoed as ``approved_target``.

    **Date-dimension binding (optional).** When ``date_table`` (the generated calendar's name)
    and ``active_date_cols`` (the set of ``(table, column)`` carrying the ACTIVE date
    relationship) are supplied, a calc that is exactly a calendar attribute of a single date
    field -- ``YEAR([Order Date])``, ``DATEPART('month', [Order Date])``, etc. (see
    ``date_attribute_binding``) -- is emitted as ``= RELATED('Date'[<attr>])`` *when that date
    field is the active date*, so the attribute is sourced once from the shared Date table rather
    than recomputed inline. A role-playing (inactive) date can't use ``RELATED`` safely (it would
    silently follow the active relationship), so it keeps the faithful inline translation. The
    bound column is tagged ``TranslatedBy = deterministic (date dimension)`` and its report row
    carries the additive ``date_bound`` / ``date_table`` / ``date_attribute`` keys.

    The engine's own ``measure_refs`` cascade (see ``_measures_part``) already resolves a calc that

    measure, the dependent translates on a later pass. What the flat handoff never says is *which few
    calcs are the bases that unlock the many*, so migration effort can't be targeted. This re-attempts
    each stub with an OPTIMISTIC seed -- every known calc name/alias assumed already translated -- and
    splits:

      * translates now  -> ``cascadable`` (the native cascade auto-resolves it once its bases are
        authored, so it needs no direct authoring);
      * still fails     -> ``irreducible`` keystone (intrinsically outside the deterministic safe
        subset -> a human / second compiler must author its base DAX), grouped by rough ``shape`` so
        authoring can be batched by kind.

    Dimension-role calcs use the column translator, which has no ``measure_refs`` cascade, so a
    dimension stub that only fails on a cross-calc reference is (correctly) irreducible: the native
    cascade lifts measures, not calculated columns.

        list for the check-in prompt.

        suggestion]}``. ``fields`` are the resolved field references (table/column/type), cross-calc

    the resolver keys on) stay untouched -- so the calc keeps the report-facing name worksheets bind
    to, and the source column still loads its real header.

    The plan is applied to a DEEP COPY of the descriptor BEFORE the base table TMDL, the field

    where a column-vs-column name clash arises). A residual case-collision from any other path

    BI objects: a **field-swap** calc (``CASE [Parameters].[X] WHEN .. THEN [FieldA] ..``) becomes a
    **field-parameter** table (the calc is *consumed* -- not also emitted as a measure/column); a
    **value/what-if** parameter referenced as a scalar (``[Sales] * [Parameters].[Rate]``) becomes a

    """One-call convenience: parse ``.tds``/``.twb`` text and assemble the Import/DirectQuery model.

    ``calcs`` are the MEASURE-role calculated fields and ``dim_calcs`` the DIMENSION/row-level ones
    (translated via column mode into DAX calculated columns); both pass straight through to
    ``assemble_import_model`` and default to ``None`` so existing callers are byte-for-byte unchanged.

    Model objects (hierarchies, display folders, RLS roles) are AUTO-DERIVED from the
    ``.tds`` and resolved against the rebuilt model, then emitted as TMDL. A caller can
    override any of the three by passing a resolved structure explicitly (in which case no
    auto-derivation runs); passing nothing reproduces the original, un-enriched behavior
    for datasources that have no such objects.

    Table **relationships** are likewise auto-wired: the joins ``parse_tds`` infers from the
    ``.tds`` ``<object-graph><relationships>`` (already resolved to emitted model columns) are
    emitted as TMDL when ``relationships`` is ``None``. Pass an explicit list (including ``[]``)
    to take full control and skip the auto-wiring -- so ``[]`` deliberately emits no relationships.

    ``select`` chooses which datasource to rebuild from a multi-datasource workbook (caption / name,
    case-insensitive); the ``Parameters`` pseudo-datasource is always skipped.

    ``parameters`` are the Tableau parameter descriptors. They default to ``None``, in which case
    they are AUTO-PARSED from ``tds_text`` (``parse_parameters``), so a field-swap calc becomes a
    field-parameter table and a value/what-if scalar reference becomes a what-if table + measure
    (see ``assemble_import_model``). Pass an explicit list (including ``[]``) to override; ``[]``
    disables parameter wiring entirely (swap/param calcs fall back to stubs).

    ``approved_calc_dax`` (``{calc_name: dax}``, case-insensitive) flips human-approved assisted
    suggestions into real measures (see ``_measures_part``). On a first pass omit it: the report's
    ``assisted_suggestions`` lists every idiom match for review; re-run with the approved subset to
    emit them. A cross-calc reference lookup is built from the FULL ``.tds`` (captions + internal
    ``Calculation_*`` names) so an argmax calc that points at a separate "max" calc resolves.

    ``descriptor`` optionally supplies a pre-built parse (e.g. a ``combine_descriptors`` union of a
    workbook's several embedded datasources). When given, the internal ``parse_tds`` is skipped and
    the model is built from it verbatim -- so every relation across every combined island lands in the
    ONE model. ``None`` (default) re-parses ``tds_text`` as before, so existing callers are unchanged.

    ``emit_linguistic`` (default ``False``) opts in to a Power BI Q&A ``cultureInfo`` part built from
    the Tableau field captions (``scripts/linguistic.py``): a ``definition/cultures/<lang>.tmdl`` part
    plus a ``ref cultureInfo`` line on ``model.tmdl``. It is OFF by default because a malformed culture
    file fails MODEL LOAD; certify the byte-shape once in Power BI Desktop / Tabular Editor before
    turning it on. When on but no caption differs from its model column, nothing is written and the
    output is byte-identical.

    Tableau assigns a calc's role by its OUTPUT type, so a purely row-level numeric calc -- e.g.
    ``INT([Dates] % 10000 / 100)`` or ``[Sales] - [Cost]`` -- is labelled a *measure* and sent to
    measure mode, where a bare row-level field reference correctly stubs. Its faithful Power BI form
    is a DAX calculated COLUMN (row context, aggregated in the visual by default -- matching how
    Tableau aggregates such a measure). This ground-truth, fail-closed router moves a calc ONLY when
    the REAL measure translator stubs it with exactly ``_ROW_LEVEL_IN_MEASURE_REASON`` AND the REAL
    column translator produces faithful DAX for it, so:

      * a measure that translates is never touched (it does not hit the reason gate);
      * a calc the column translator cannot render faithfully stays a measure stub, exactly as before;
      * a rerouted calc was, by definition, a bare-row-level *stub* as a measure, so it never seeded
        the ``measure_refs`` cascade -- any measure that referenced it already stubbed and still does
        (no phantom, no regression).

    **Cascade-aware fix-point.** A row-level calc frequently references a *sibling* calc -- a
    boolean dimension flag (``IF [Is CY] THEN [Qty] END``) or two other row-level measure calcs
    (a difference ``[CYQ] - [PYQ]``). The column probe must therefore see the SAME sibling
    ``column_refs`` the ``_calc_columns_part`` builder assembles, and it must ITERATE: a difference
    calc only becomes column-translatable AFTER its two operands have themselves been moved onto the
    column path. So each round rebuilds ``column_refs`` over the *current* dim calcs (originals plus
    everything moved so far) and re-probes the still-measure calcs; a round that moves nothing ends
    the loop. Without both the shared ``column_refs`` and the outer loop the whole downstream cascade
    stays blocked (the historical bug: the probe passed no ``column_refs`` at all).

    The change is strictly additive: each moved calc goes stub -> faithful calculated column. Returns
    ``(new_measure_calcs, new_dim_calcs, rerouted_names)``; with nothing to move the input lists are
    returned unchanged (identity-preserving fast path). ``skip_names`` (case-insensitive) pins a calc
    to the measure path regardless -- used for names already consumed as field parameters, flag
    sources, or given a designated measure landing by the ``approved_calc_dax`` (human-approved /
    second-compiler) tier. ``resolve_for`` (optional ``calc -> resolver | None``) supplies a
    per-calc island-scoped resolver for a multi-datasource workbook; when ``None`` every calc uses the

    Calculated fields are **auto-extracted** (pass ``calcs`` to override, or ``calcs=[]`` to emit no
    measures). When auto-extracted, calcs are routed by Tableau role: measure-role calcs become
    measures and dimension-role calcs become DAX calculated columns (``dim_calcs``); pass either
    explicitly to take control. Returns ``{"parts", "report", "bind"}`` -- ``bind`` is the
    credential-free connection target from ``connection_details_for_bind`` -- plus, when ``write_to``
    is given, the persisted path:

    * ``as_pbip=False`` (default) writes ``<model_name>.SemanticModel/`` and adds ``"model_dir"``.
    * ``as_pbip=True`` writes an openable ``.pbip`` project and adds ``"pbip"``.

    When ``source`` is a workbook with more than one real datasource, pass ``datasource=`` (caption
    or name) to choose which to migrate; with several present and none chosen this raises
    ``AmbiguousDatasourceError`` listing the options (call ``list_workbook_datasources`` to enumerate
    them). The ``Parameters`` pseudo-datasource is always skipped.

    **Datasource-scoped -- for a whole workbook use ``migrate_workbook``.** This call builds the
    *model* for one datasource; it never rebuilds the workbook's report. To rebuild an entire workbook
    as an openable project -- its embedded datasource(s) AND the report bound to them -- call
    ``migrate_estate.migrate_workbook(source, write_to=...)`` (the single-workbook form of
    ``migrate_estate``). Reach for that whenever the input is a workbook and you want the report, not
    just a datasource model.

    **Default-direct policy.** A datasource is rebuilt in place -- each table bound to its own source
    -- whenever that is safe, INCLUDING a multi-connection federation (Power BI relates the tables in
    the model layer). Only a genuinely-undoable shape (a cross-engine ``join``/``union`` relation,
    unfoldable custom SQL, an unknown connector, or a table with no resolvable columns) is reported as
    a NEEDS-STORAGE-DECISION fallback: this call then returns ``parts={}`` with
    ``report["fallback"]=True`` and the ``report["storage_decision"]`` (default: rebuild
    direct-to-source as Import) instead of raising. DirectLake is an explicit opt-in, never
    auto-selected -- only when the decision is the land-to-Delta option does this write a
    ``report["landing_plan"]`` (see ``directlake_landing_plan``) and, with ``write_to``, a
    ``<model_name>.landing_plan.json`` (``"landing_plan_path"``).

    **Local-POC opt-in (``local_data=``).** For a laptop demo with NO Fabric and NO cloud
    credentials, pass ``local_data`` to build an Import model backed by LOCAL CSV files instead. This
    bypasses the storage-decision fallback entirely (no lakehouse this skill never writes to), so even an
    unmapped connector (S3 / generic ODBC-JDBC / Web Data Connector) yields a clickable model. Accepts:

    * a ``{table_name: csv_path}`` dict;
    * a directory of ``*.csv`` (keyed by file stem) or a single ``.csv`` path;
    * a ``.hyper`` / ``.tdsx`` / ``.twbx`` path, or ``True`` to auto-extract ``source``'s embedded
      ``.hyper`` to CSV (requires the optional ``tableauhyperapi``; CSVs land in
      ``<write_to>/<model_name>.Data`` or a temp dir). The data-binding outcome is recorded under the
      additive ``report["local_import"]`` key.

    Extra keyword args (``relationships``, ``hierarchies``, ``mark_as_date``, ``flatfile_path`` ...)
    pass straight through to ``migrate_tds_to_semantic_model``. Deploy stays a separate, explicit
    step (``deploy_to_fabric.py``) -- this function never touches the network or credentials.
